# d3-map-base

This is a simple base exmaple to create a plain map with d3 created with the help of [this great tutorial by Andy Barefoot](https://medium.com/@andybarefoot/making-a-map-using-d3-js-8aa3637304ee).
This project does not use any frameworks or libraries other than [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3).
To run the project, simply start a web server in root.
